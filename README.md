# Lets Encrypt Automation

I've taken inspiration from this [article:](https://medium.com/@brentrobinson5/automating-certificate-management-with-azure-and-lets-encrypt-fee6729e2b78) and tried to provide an environment which will build the resources and tooling to generate certificates and store them in a Key Vault for consumption by Azure App Service, Azure Application Gateway...etc.
